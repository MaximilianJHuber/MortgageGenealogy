Roadmap:

- [x] Commercial real estate with retail space: We have downloaded, processed, and OCRed more than 7 million pages or 550GB worth of image documents on the mortgages of more than 30,000 properties.
- [x] Entity extraction: We trained an AI to read the "Mortgage Schedule" pages.
- [ ] Convert list of entities to episodic data 
- [ ] Extend to all other commercial real estate: more than 60,000 properties.
